A broad differentiation between the thermal effects of activity levels and clothing/equipment worn across a range of popular sports in Australia is also provided.</p> <h2 data-svelte-h="svelte-7y0e69">Aim</h2> <p data-svelte-h="svelte-15poqsa">The aim of this policy is to provide evidence-based guidance for protecting the health of those participating in sport and physical activity from the potentially ill effects of extreme heat in the summer, while ensuring that play is not unnecessarily interrupted. As new research findings emerge, the policy will be updated accordingly. Intended users are sporting administrators, coaches and sports medical teams responsible for the safety and wellbeing of people engaging in sport and physical activity in hot weather, as well as individuals wishing to manage heat stress risk during planned training activities.</p> <h2 data-svelte-h="svelte-pn0q5l">Disclaimer and User Agreement</h2> <p data-svelte-h="svelte-1rir1dg">This application is intended for informational and educational purposes only.
